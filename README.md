# Prediction Activity

A mini-prediction competition. Who can produce the best model to predict pass/fail

### Download
* Download the Open University Learning Analytics dataset from [here](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset)
* Import the `studentVle.csv`, `studentAssessment.csv` and `studentInfo.csv` files into R
### Wrangling
* Calculate the average daily number of clicks (site interactions) for each student from the `studentVle` dataset
* Calculate the average assessment score for each student from the `studentAssessment` dataset
* Merge your click and assessment score average values into the the `studentInfo` dataset
### Create a Validation Set
* Split your data into two new datasets, `TRAINING` and `TEST`, by **randomly** selecting 25% of the students for the `TEST` set
### Explore
* Generate summary statistics for the variable `final_result`
* Ensure that the final_result variable is binary (Remove all students who withdrew from a courses and convert all students who recieved distinctions to pass)
* Visualize the distributions of each of the variables for insight
* Visualize relationships between variables for insight
### Model Training
* Install the `caret` package
* You will be allocated one of the following models to test:

  CART (`RPART`), Conditional Inference Trees (`party`), Naive Bayes (`naivebayes`), Logistic Regression (`gpls`)

* Using the `trainControl` command in the `caret` package create a 10-fold cross-validation harness:   
  `control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10)`
* Using the standard caret syntax fit your model and measure accuracy:  
   `fit <- train(final_result~., data=TRAINING, method=YOUR MODEL, metric="accuracy", trControl=control)`
* Generate a summary of your results and create a visualization of the accuracy scores for your ten trials
* Make any tweaks to your model to try to improve its performance
### Model Testing
* Use the `predict` function to test your model  
  `predictions <- predict(fit, TEST)`
* Generate a confusion matrix for your model test  
  `confusionMatrix(predictions, TEST$final_result)`
